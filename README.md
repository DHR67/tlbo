# **Hybrid TLBO for Machine Learning Hyperparameter Optimization**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements **Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO)** and its hybrid variant to optimize hyperparameters for various machine learning models. It uses **TLBO** to enhance model performance by avoiding local optima and improving computational efficiency. The dataset used in this project is the **Student Performance Data Set** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains academic and demographic details of students from two Portuguese schools. The attributes include:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, family size, etc.
- **Academic Information**: Study time, failures, school support, grades (G1, G2, G3), etc.
- **Personal & Lifestyle Information**: Alcohol consumption, health, free time, absences, etc.

## **Models Implemented**

The following machine learning models are optimized using TLBO and Hybrid TLBO:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
  
Each model's hyperparameters are optimized to improve performance on student grade prediction.
